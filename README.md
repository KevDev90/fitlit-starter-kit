# FitLit


## Overview

In this project we created a FitLit app where a user can see their activity, sleep, and hydration data for the day and for the week. It also displays trends in their activity data as well as comparisons against their friends and all other users. We used ES6 to build our classes, including our properties and methods, and we used mocha and chai for testing. Our project can be viewed on our GitHub pages here: https://kevdev90.github.io/fitlit-starter-kit/src/index.html
