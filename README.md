# FitLit


## Overview

In this project we created a FitLit app where a user can see their activity, sleep, and hydration data for the day and for the week. It also displays trends in their activity data as well as comparisons against their friends and all other users.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub).

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```


## Testing

There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).
